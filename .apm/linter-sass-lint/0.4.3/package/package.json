It will be used with files that have the “Sass” or “SCSS” syntax.\n\n[sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) is a node only sass linter and isn't related to [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint).\n\n### Installation\n\nYou'll need to have [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) installed to use this plugin\n\nA version of [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) comes bundled with this plugin but if you'd like to install it manually you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint).\n\n#### Plugin installation\n\n```\napm install linter-sass-lint\n```\n\n#### .sass-lint.yml\n\nA `.sass-lint.yml` config file is required for this linter. You can find an example of one [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/blob/master/lib/config/sass-lint.yml) and documentation on how to configure this and each of the rules [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs).\n\nBy default this plugin will search up the directory tree for this file, you can also specify a path to this config file in the plugin settings or in `~/.atom/config.cson` file. Usually you would place this config file in your projects root and keep it under version control too.\n\n### Settings\n\nThere are two options you can configure either within the plugin or by editing your `~/.atom/config.cson` file.\n\n* `executablePath` - this is the path to a locally installed `sass-lint` package (by default a version will be included with and used by this plugin).\n\n* `configPath` - this is path to a `.sass-lint.yml` config file.\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions, suggestions and fixes are more than welcome.\n\nThis plugin follows a simple style guide.\n\n1. Indentation is 2 spaces.\n1. All code should pass the coffeelinter linter, the config of which is included in this repository.\n\nGeneral contribution guidelines apply\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository\n1. Create a feature/hotfix branch off of master\n1. Commit and push the branch\n1. Make a pull request\n\nIf you're unsure on whether your contribution will be required then please file an issue first and we can discuss it.\n\nIf you find any problems with the `sass-lint` itself with regards to bugs in rules then please visit the [sass-lint Github Page](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) please note that `sass-lint` is young and still under heavy development.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/DanPurdy/linter-sass-lint/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/DanPurdy/linter-sass-lint#readme","_id":"linter-sass-lint@0.4.3","_shasum":"55ccb4a5a77e5702be0ede561b65258b547db44d","_resolved":"file:../d-1151111-4013-8d1o4n/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151111-4013-8d1o4n/package.tgz"}
