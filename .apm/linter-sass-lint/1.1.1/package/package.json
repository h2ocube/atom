It will be used with files that have the “Sass” or “SCSS” syntax.\n\n[sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) is a node only sass linter and isn't related to [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint).\n\n### Installation\n\nYou'll need to have [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) installed to use this plugin\n\n**The current latest version of [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) comes bundled with this plugin but if you'd like to install it manually you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint).**\n\n#### Plugin installation\n\n```\napm install linter-sass-lint\n```\n\n#### .sass-lint.yml\n\nA `.sass-lint.yml` config file is required for this linter. You can find an example of one [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/blob/master/lib/config/sass-lint.yml) and documentation on how to configure this and each of the rules [here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs).\n\nBy default this plugin will search up the directory tree for this file, you can also specify a path to this config file in the plugin settings or in `~/.atom/config.cson` file. Usually you would place this config file in your projects root and keep it under version control too.\n\nYou can use the `noConfigDisable` option to prevent any attempts at linting (and the missing config error messages you will encounter) if a valid config is not found.\n\nBy default a config file found in the root of your currently open project will take preference over a config file specified with the `configFile` option.\n\n### Settings\n\nThere are three options you can configure either within the plugin or by editing your `~/.atom/config.cson` file.\n\n* `noConfigDisable` - Enable to prevent any linting if a valid config file (`.sass-lint.yml`) is not found in the project root.\n\n* `configFile` - this is path to a `.sass-lint.yml` config file, this should only be used if you'd like to specify a global config file rather than rely on a project config file in the root of your project.\n\n* `globalNodePath` This is where you can set your global node installation path. Run `npm get prefix` and paste the result here. This will be where `linter-sass-lint` will then search for the globally installed version of `sass-lint` if you choose to enable this with `globalSassLint`.\n\n* `globalSassLint` This allows you to specify that you want to use your globally installed version of `sass-lint` (`npm install -g sass-lint`) instead of the version bundled with `linter-sass-lint`.\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributions, suggestions and fixes are more than welcome.\n\nPlease read the [Contribution Guidlines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nA general sense of the guidelines can be found below.\n\n1. Indentation is 2 spaces.\n1. All code should pass the coffeelinter linter, the config of which is included in this repository (`npm-test`).\n1. the .editorconfig file should be used to ensure a consistent style [info here](http://editorconfig.org/)\n\nGeneral contribution guidelines apply\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository\n1. Create a feature/hotfix branch off of master\n1. Lint your code `npm-test`\n1. Commit and push the branch\n1. Make a pull request\n\nIf you're unsure on whether your contribution will be required then please file an issue first and we can discuss it.\n\nIf you find any problems with the `sass-lint` itself with regards to bugs in rules then please visit the [sass-lint Github Page](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) please note that `sass-lint` is young and still under heavy development.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-sass-lint/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-sass-lint#readme","_id":"linter-sass-lint@1.1.1","_shasum":"6eb1dd5f54d748cb77c3baace48b1f5b07279c92","_resolved":"file:../d-116129-10566-x8fijy/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116129-10566-x8fijy/package.tgz"}
